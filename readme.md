### This project is new! Help build this directory of tools & resources!
You'll notice that not many resources are currently listed. [nwdata.org](http://nwdata.org) started on **November 7, 2013**, and we'll be building out the resources with the goal of having an awesome directory by the end of the year.

### This project is open source!
